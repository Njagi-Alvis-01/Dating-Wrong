                "I said those words to myself with the easy confidence of a man who believed he had finally decoded the mechanics of love. I had already survived the wreckage of betrayal. I had tasted the slow, bitter decay of incompatibility. I had allowed the loud opinions of people around me to influence choices that should have belonged strictly to me. Worse still, I had once used another human being as an emotional bandage, a shield against the lingering pain left behind by someone I had loved before her.",
                "I thought the scars had taught me enough. I thought heartbreak had graduated me. I thought I had become wiser.",
                "Perhaps that very confidence was my first mistake. Surviving heartbreak does not automatically mean you have learned everything you need to know; sometimes, it only means you have become more adept at carrying the weight of the damage.",
                "I was about to discover that a man can enter a new chapter with noble intentions and still carry the old, unexamined version of himself right through the front door.",
                "By the time I met Mumbi, I was emotionally exhausted. I had zero appetite for games, subtle psychological warfare, or relationships that required me to spend every waking hour guessing where I stood. I did not want another partner who made me feel as though I was navigating a minefield in heavy boots.",

                "There was a quiet elegance to her that instantly commanded the room. She was striking light-skinned, meticulously put together, and carrying herself with a calm self-assurance that made her stand out without ever having to raise her voice or demand attention. She was the kind of woman a man could admire from across a crowded sanctuary and think, *There is something genuinely different about her.*",
                "But it wasn't just her appearance that caught me. I saw potential. I saw the foundational qualities I believed would make a grounding, steady partner. Because of everything I had endured prior to that season, I was perhaps too eager to believe I had finally found the living contrast to my past trauma.",
                "*Maybe this is the one.*",
                "That thought arrived with dangerous speed. I approached her. She accepted. And just like that, another chapter began.",
                "At first, everything felt effortless. We went on dates, spent our free hours lingering around campus, visited each other’s places, and talked on the phone late into the night until sleep reluctantly cut off conversations neither of us wanted to end.",
                "There were quiet evenings when we discussed life with a depth that made it feel as though we had known each other for years. There were mornings when a simple text from her could recalibrate the entire trajectory of my day. I became deeply invested in her, perhaps far too quickly.",
                "I began measuring her against every painful experience that had come before. Where others had brought ambiguity, Mumbi seemed to bring clarity. Where others had triggered my suspicion, Mumbi seemed entirely trustworthy. Where others had drained my energy, she seemed to restore it."

                "Church became a cornerstone of our shared routine. As a pastor’s son, I had grown up within the rhythms of ministry, so having Mumbi beside me during Sunday services felt natural, almost predestined. After the service, I would take her for lunch. We would sit at a small local spot, talking long after our plates were cleared. Afterward, I would walk her home. It became our rhythm: Church. Lunch. Conversation. Escorting her home. Calling later in the evening. Repeating it all over again.",
                "Our connection seemed healthy and promising. At least, that is what I allowed myself to believe.",
                "There was, however, one habit of Mumbi’s that grated on me early on. She was not particularly a lover of exclusive boundaries in public spaces. Whenever we walked together across campus and encountered one of her male friends, she would stop dead in her tracks. There would be a warm, prolonged embrace, followed by animated conversation and suddenly, I was no longer the man walking beside her. I became the third wheel standing two steps back, waiting like an awkward hired guard while two old acquaintances caught up.",
                "Sometimes I would pull out my phone, pretending to scroll through messages I didn’t care about. Other times, I would stare at the road and silently count the seconds. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Fifteen.",
                "Eventually, she would step back toward me as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. \"Sorry about that,\" she would say lightly, adjusting her bag.",

                "Looking back now, I have to ask: How many red flags do we rebrand as harmless personality quirks simply because we are terrified of what we might discover if we take them seriously? As our relationship matured, the community around us took notice. My friends saw the way I looked at Mumbi, how consistently we moved together, and how effortlessly we appeared to be charting a path past university life.",

                "By nature and by training as a journalist, I am a social person. I am genuinely curious about human stories, where people come from, how they think, what shapes their worldview. During the event, I crossed paths with a woman I hadn't met before. We struck up a casual conversation. There was no secret exchange, no hidden flirtation, and no ulterior motive. We simply hit it off as fellow students, laughing and swapping campus stories. I was operating in my natural social element.",
                "Mumbi, however, saw something entirely different.",
                "She went quiet. Not an ordinary silence, but the heavy, suffocating kind that instantly shifts the temperature of a room. I noticed her retreat from the group dynamic. I looked over at her once, then twice, but I didn't probe. Perhaps I assumed that if something were truly wrong, she would speak up. Perhaps I was too relaxed, or perhaps I simply could not conceive that a harmless, open conversation could trigger a structural fault line in our relationship.",
                "The afternoon ended, and we departed for our respective hostels.",

I don't think we should continue this.” I reread the message twice. My initial reaction was sheer disbelief. *Seriously? Over that?* There are moments when"

We survived our first real test. I chose the path of least resistance.",

But the moment Keter appeared, I became invisible.",

Her story had begun long before I entered the frame, shaped by a history of attachment and abandonment I knew nothing about. When Mumbi first arrived on campus as a freshman, she was wide-eyed and navigating university life with that familiar mix of freedom and vulnerability. On her registration day, she met **Otombo Gabby**.",

                "His name was **Abayomi Agu**, a charismatic Nigerian student from Lagos who ironically was one of Otombo’s friends through their church fellowship. They shared meals, discussed life, and trusted each other. That existing trust made what Abayomi did next all the more devastating.",
                "Abayomi decided he wanted Mumbi.",
                "He didn't pursue her quietly. He came with grand visions, talking of Lagos, real estate, luxury, and a life far grander than the modest reality of campus living. But beyond the material promises, Abayomi positioned himself as her ultimate emotional confidant. When she was stressed, he validated her. When she felt insecure, he spoke to her potential. He patiently engineered a space for himself right in the middle of her world.",
                "Slowly, Mumbi’s warmth toward Otombo began to cool. Her calls grew shorter, her availability shrank, and the evening walks ceased. Otombo felt the shift, but he couldn't imagine that the architect of his heartbreak was his close friend.",
                "The truth revealed itself brutally one evening. Otombo walked to Mumbi’s hostel to drop off a set of revision notes. As he rounded the corner near the entrance, he saw them under the dim light: Mumbi and Abayomi, locked in an intimate kiss.",
                "Otombo froze. The world went quiet around him. Months of shared routines, quiet conversations, and unspoken promises collapsed in an instant. He could have confronted them; he could have raised his voice. Instead, he stood in silence for a few seconds, turned around, and walked back into the dark."

Maybe she chose me while carrying wounds she had never given herself space to heal, and I chose her while carrying unexamined wounds of my own. We were both sincere. We both meant well. But sincerity alone has never been enough to make a broken foundation hold.*",
